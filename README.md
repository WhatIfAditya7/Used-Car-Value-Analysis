#  Used Car Value Analysis <br>
Using R programming with integration of Machine Learning to understand the resale value of vehicles. <br>

# Solution <br>
The first step was to identify does the price of car fluctuates due to some other features and their significance. Using significance testing and p-value analysis, we got to know that fuel type does affect the price. <br>

The second feature was transmission, and was statistically significant. <br>

Now, using Decision Tree Algorithm, we were able to predict the price of vehicle. <br>
