#  Used Car Value Analysis <br>
Using R programming with integration of Machine Learning to understand the resale value of vehicles. <br>

# Solution <br>
The first step was to identify does the price of car fluctuates due to some other features and their significance. Using significance testing and p-value analysis, we got to know that fuel type does affect the price. <br>

The second feature was transmission, and was statistically significant. <br>

Now, using Decision Tree Algorithm, we were able to predict the price of vehicle. <br>

The second step was to check does Mileage of the car is significant. Using significance testing and p-value analysis, we got to know that features affecting the Mileage. <br>
The Mileage was affected by the fuel type of the vehicle. <br>

The next feature was Manufacturer delivering the best mileage. <br>

The last feature was Location best suited to drive vehicle with best Mileage. <br>

Using all the features available, We identified the best manufacturer company delivering the best mileage with the preferred location. We have used Decision Tree Algorithm. <br>

With all the features we got statistically significant, we conclude that the final resale price depends on the Manufactuer, Fuel Type, Mileage and Location of the vehicle.
